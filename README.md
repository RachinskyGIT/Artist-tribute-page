Good afternoon! My name is Stas Rachinsky.
I want to introduce you to my final project, Tribute page website. 
In essence, this is something between the artistТs portfolio and tribe Page, because I still imagine still a living person.

This site is dedicated to my girlfriend, Alona Barkov, who is a professional artist, she was repatriated to Israel a year ago from russia.

In the development and production of the site, I was inspired, among other things, by Cate Blanchet tribute page, as well as other resources. My goal was to make a simple, minimalistic, but at the same time, a beautiful and tasteful site. I believe that I coped well with this task.

The site is made in three supplementing tones: green, mustard, light beige. I also used the Baumans font as the main one, it seems to me that this is a very beautiful font suitable for the site about the contemporary artist.

The site is divided into several segments, each of which leads a link from the page available at any time at the top of the page, in a header.

The first is the home part of the page where we see the portrait, name and occupation of Alona. I also want to note my design solution, to tilt the main signature so that it is parallel to the oblique lines of the photo in the background. It is very beautiful and looks more aesthetic than just an intersecting horizontal line. I achieved this effect using the УrotationФ command.
After the Home section, next section is the Biography. I will also note that all sections are separated by a beige strip with the name of the next section.

The biography describes the professional life of the artist, as well as her photo is presented. As you can notice [здесь помасштабировать страницу +-], the photo is placed relative to the text, so that when the scale changes it does not go anywhere.

Next is the УArtsФ section. The last 2 large works that Alona did are presented here. I decided not to put the works in one line, but allocated each work with a separate level and color so that the user could focus at one work at a time. I also thought that it would be beautiful to make a layout of the left and right, and not just put everything in boring way in one row on one edge.

The next section is the student projects of Alona. This is graphics, not painting, so I identified them in a separate section. Since the graphics is easier to draw and it was done much more, I did not upload all her works on the site, because this is the site mainly about a person, and not about her works. Therefore, I highlighted several main series of graphics, and all the others are available on the link on another page where there are all other works. The Уmore workФ button leads to this page. In reality, such a page does not exist, because I did not make it. But by clicking on the button, you can close your eyes and imagine that you are going to a page with a long gallery of works. If necessary, I can make such a page.

The last part of the site is a section with the Instagram and Email links of the artist. At the bottom there is also a footer with the name of the site-maker (me) and the year of making. The name contains a link to my github.

I don't have much time left, so I'll leave it up to you to go through the site's code and evaluate it yourself.

I will only note that the site is also adapted for viewing on medium and small screens. I made several adjustments for normal display, such as for example, hidden overlay and the transition of the main inscription from the center to the up of the page so that the inscription does not overlap the face.
In addition, the sizes and indentation of the remaining elements on the page were also adjusted. I think in the case of a display for mobile devices I still have where to strive, and this could be done better, but even since it is also not bad.
I hope you will like my work! Thank you for your attention!
